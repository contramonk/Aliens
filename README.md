# Aliens

##Description
Aliens is a CRUD project done by Jonathan Edwards.

##What is Aliens?
Aliens is a crud application created for the week 7 project at skill distillery. It's requirements are:
1. Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality work with one of your objects through a web gui.
2. The project must be launched to AWS
3. The project must be added to your github account with a README spelling out

My spin on this was an Alien building application where you are presented with a list of aliens that can be added, edited, and removed.

##Technologies
1. Java
2. Spring
3. HTML
4. XML
4. CSS
5. Bootstrap

##The Future
I would like to add filtering capabilities.
